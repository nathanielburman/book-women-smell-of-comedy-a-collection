And now for my favorite smelly comedian female smelly joke, the one you have all been waiting for... from SNL... she's back.

... breath a bit ...

The stage is setup like an apartment room. a couple people in the room and the door crashes open and in flys a woman with her hands crossed and under her arm pits.

classic joke

but its her who-ha not her arm pits. So heres what we want to do.

send in three homosexuals in furry costumes, then kick them in the balls...

...

They knew what we were doing. Okay, batten down the hatches. BANG BOOM.

Load up the next shots...

...

The actors wait for their cue and BOOM the room starts shaking from an earthquake

...

But she keeps her hands in her arm pits and falls over on the ground

the camera zooms in really serious to her on the ground

she wont smell her arm pits! she just won't do it! And the ground shakes and shakes and she shakes with the ground. All the other actors shake around.

Then someone says, WHAT THE HELL IS THAT SMELL?!?!?!

Fast cut to the producer

Deadpool snorts another line off of lady with a new baby nose.

He makes a quick joke we don't hear about smelly something and...

were out. CUT.
